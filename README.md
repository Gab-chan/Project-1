Codename: Game Hunt

## General Idea for app

allo the user to get additional information on a game before purchase (if it has already been released).

the app will allow a user to search the name of a game and get the best prices and where to buy it (using the BestBuy Api) or find a person who is streaming the game at that moment (using the twitch Api).

## Sketch of the website



## APIs being used

    * Currently using the Twitch API v5 as it has the ability to obtain the information needed to show on our website
