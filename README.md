Codename: Game Hunt

## General Idea for app

allo the user to get additional information on a game before purchase (if it has already been released).

the app will allow a user to search the name of a game and get the best prices and where to buy it (using the BestBuy Api) or find a person who is streaming the game at that moment (using the twitch Api).
